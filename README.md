The best Pancakes ever.


## Ingredients for one stack o' cakes:
### Dry:
 - 125g flour
 - 20g sugar
 - 1/2 pack baking powder (~1 tea spoon)
 - pinch of salt   

### Wet:
 - 220g buttermilk 
 - 2 eggs
 - 1 tablespoon of butter, molten
 - 1 tablespoon of (vanilla) sugar

Start by mixing all the dry ingredients together, prferably sieving the flour first. Then seperate the egg yolk into a small bowl and the whites into a larger mixing bowl. Beat the whites until they are foamy, not compleatly stiff! Now add the molten butter and the (vanilla) sugar to the yolks and stir it util it's smooth and glossy. Add in the buttermilk and the yolk mixture to the egg whites and slowly fold in the dry mix. Let everything set for 10 minutes, then 420 bake it ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).I usualy use 2-3 tablespoons of the mixture for one pancake. I also recommend you use concentrated butter as it just tastes way better. Butaris is the best brand. Get it, it's worth it.

You can add in blueberries, bananas, strawberries, rasins or whatever you like. I like just a litte vanilla sugar best.
